2. Genre
    FPS
3. Inspiration
4. Gameplay
    * Firearm-heavy 3V3 FPS: low utility options b/c hard to code
    * Tank, DPS, Support: different weapon builds for each
        - Tank: vehicle (unique option for engagement)
        - DPS: choose from gun and melee (gun for long range, melee for flanking)
        - Support: choose from debuff and healing (debuff for agressive engage, heal for supporting)
    * Spectre Divide: control 2 or more character per player
        - maybe cut down to 1V1 in this case - easier server handling
        - more like RTS style FPS <- look fun
            fight only when engaged, timeouts, make dudes go to certain pos, sth like simulation too
    * Timeouts: each team can timeout in the middle of the battle to setup and edit their strats
